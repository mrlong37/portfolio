  <p class="bio" style="display:none">Hello! I'm Madeleine Long. I'm currently a student at Signature School that loves STEM-based subjects. I play flute in the Evansville Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, and hope to continue that passion in college. </p>
  <p class="hobbies" style="display:none">In my free time I enjoy playing flute, learning bass guitar, spending time with friends, and painting my nails. I'm always looking for new hobbies, granted I don't have much time in the school year.</p>
  <p class="future" style="display:none">In the future, I hope to pursue a career in medicine. Currently, I'm interested in medical research, but I'm always fascinated in the areas where medicine and technology collide. I also hope to continue my passion for music and play in a professional orchestra one day.</p>
  <p class="experience" style="display:none">I've learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java (through an AP Computer Science A course).</p>
  <p class="academics" style="display:none">I'm an upcoming senior at Signature School. I enjoy everything STEM-related and hope to continue that passion into college. I've been an active member in the numerous clubs my school offers, including Writer's Block and Mu Alpha Theta. Additionally, I've taken leadership roles my school's German and Robotics Club.</p>
